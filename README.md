# Introduction

CopyFair Corp is an a idea and attempt at practical implementation of a
sustainable Open Source economical model.

*CopyFair Corp* can be explained in just a couple of simple steps:

The copyright ownership should be assigned to a legal entity running under
rules defined in the project status. *CopyFair Corp Project* aim is to help
people establish and run their own *CopyFair Corporations*.

By submitting work (usually, but not only, code) to the project, contributor
agree to transfer copyrights to the *CopyFair Corp* in exchange for stake in it.
The practical implementation would be putting a special tag in the git commit log
stating payment method (Bitcoin or potentially other crypto-currencies
address) and the price (eg. hours worth of work).  If the pull request gets
merged, it means the contribution was accepted by the *CopyFair Corp* and this fact
gets recorded in the project's history (eg. `git log`). After that the
contributor is rewarded with an agreed number of project shares.

The shares should be valid for a specific time (eg. 5 years) - long enough to be attractive and encourage
long term participation, but short enough to sustain the inflow of contribution, even to a legacy projects.

The Project should be licensed under FairCopy License (eg. [THE FAIR COMMONS GENERIC
LICENSE v.0][fair commons generic license]). Which means it is Open Source, but
for-profits need to license it. It's up to *CopyFair Corp* to decide Projects licensing
terms. The project should own and maintain and offical Bitcoin payment address under
control of it's leaders.

The profits from licensing fees should be distributed among the shareholders,
and used to fund other project costs (like hosting servers etc.).

Due to Bitcoin transparency, licensing parties don't even need to contact
the Project owners to use it. All they have to do is to pay the official
licensing price to an official address and keep the record of the transaction
and private key used to prove they controlled it.

To prevent fraud, project should use a shared multi-signature (M-to-N) official
Bitcoin address in control of the project leaders. Since the Project's income,
dividends paid, and share distribution are public and recorded correspondingly:
in Bitcoin blockchain and project history public, it's easy to verify that all
the rules are being followed.

The decision making and fund distribution should be proportional to the total
stake of the shareholder. The selected number of highest project shareholders
should be nominated project leaders for a given term (eg. a calendar year).
After that time, new leaders should be nominated.
